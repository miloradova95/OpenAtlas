Artifacts
=========

.. toctree::

This tutorial describes how to create a new artifact and add information to it.
The following elements are involved:

* :doc:`/entity/artifact`: A physical object, made by humans – e.g. a coin,
  a letter or a tool
* :doc:`/entity/actor`: As creator and/or owner of the artifact
* :doc:`/entity/event`: Creation of the artifact
* :doc:`/entity/file`: You can upload an image file connected to the artifact
* :doc:`/entity/reference`: Link a reference to the artifact

Add a new artifact
------------------
To create an artifact as representation of the object you want to add:

* Click on :doc:`/entity/artifact` in the :doc:`/ui/menu` and create a new
  entry by using the **+ Artifact** button
* Choose a descriptive **name**
* Select an appropriate :doc:`/entity/type` from the list
* **Owned by**: If applicable, choose an owner of the artifact, e.g. a museum
  it is stored at
* Add further information e.g. **date** or **description** or choose option
  from type trees
* Press **Insert** to save the entry

Regarding date: the begin date represents the creation of the artifact and can
be entered as a time span. Regarding the description field:  this can be used
to record  information that is not covered by the several types you can choose
from above. Keep in mind, it has several advantages to cover as much information
as possible by using types over free text in the description field. If there is
no fitting type, please follow this :doc:`instructions</examples/types>`
to add new types to the list. Please note, that “owned by” is not used to link
a creator of an artifact. You can link a creator by adding a creation event
(see below).

Add a reference to the artifact
-------------------------------
To link a reference to the newly created artifact, choose
:doc:`/entity/reference` from the tabs

Then choose from the following options:

* Link the artifact to an already existing reference by using the **Link**
  button
* Create a new :doc:`/entity/reference` by using the **+Bibliography** or
  **+Edition** button
* Create a new :doc:`external reference</entity/reference>` by using the
  **+External** reference button

Add a file to the artifact
--------------------------
To add an image file to the artifact, choose **File** from the tabs. Then choose
from the following options:

* Link the artifact to an already uploaded file
* Upload a new file by using the **+File** button, you can add information and
  choose a file here

Link a creation event
---------------------
To do so, click the **Event** tab. Here you can choose between a move event
(**+Move button**) and a creation event (**+Production button**). Tab the
+Production button (to learn how a move event can be used, please see the
tutorial on :doc:`/examples/letters`).

* Choose a descriptive **name** for the creation event
* Select an appropriate :doc:`/entity/type` from the list
* Add other information as needed, e.g. a date or add free text in the
  description field
* Press **Insert** to save the entry

Add a creator to the creation event
-----------------------------------
If the creator of an artifact is known, you can add the person after saving the
creation event by clicking **Event** in the artifact’s view. On the event’s
landing page, click the **Actor** tab to link a creator (or other kind of actor
involved).

Here you can:

* Link the creation event to an already existing :doc:`/entity/actor`
* Create a new person as actor connected to the :doc:`/entity/event`
* Create a new group as actor connected to the event

Please use **Link** here to be able to choose an actor as creator (or add a new
actor, go back to the event page, choose actor - link again and follow the steps
below). You can now add the following information:

* Type of the actor, in this case choose creator
* Actor: choose the creator of the artifact from a list of already added actors
* Change activity “**from participated**” in to “**performed**”
* if wanted, add a date and/or description

With the above steps you have created an artifact connected to a creation event
and actor as creator.

Add multiple locations to an artifact
-------------------------------------
First of all, adding an artifact to more than one :doc:`/entity/place` or
:doc:`/entity/feature` is not possible. If an artifact has a link to multiple
locations, it is possible to keep track of that in the following way:

* Choose the :doc:`/entity/place` the artifact has it's first occurrence at -
  e.g. the production site or a place an artifact was found at during
  archaeological excavation.
* link any other place the artifact is linked to by adding a move event
  - e.g. when an artifact is transfered to a place where it is later found
  during an archaeological excavation after the production event or when it is
  moved to a museum or sold to a new owner. Click here to see a short tutorial
  on adding a :doc:`/move_event`

**Example:** Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa in his workshop in Florence,
therefore Florence would be linked to the artifact as place. It was then
acquired by King Francis of France and exhibited in Château d'Amboise. This
change of location can also be tracked in the database by a :doc:`/move_event`.
Another :doc:`/move_event` maps the transfer of the image to Fountainebleau.
By adding further move events the way of the picture to the Louvre in Paris
can be documented.
